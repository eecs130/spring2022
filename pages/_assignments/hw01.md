Pick a site you use often to conduct a design and accessibility review on it. Your report/review may be in written or video form. Your report /review should include:

* Images/video captures of the site
* Relevant links to the site
* Relevant links to and/or images/video captures of similar sites for comparisons


## Composition Analysis
* Does this site have good design?
* What do they do well (recall the principles of contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity)?
* What could they improve on?

## Accessibility Analysis
* What accessibility checks did you do?
* How did you do them?
* How accessible was the site?
* What changes could/should it make to improve its accessibility?
* How do comparable sites do a better or worse job with regard to accessibility?
