From Anna: Here's a couple links to help you host your project on a custom domain! Again, it's really easy to purchase a domain through GoDaddy or Google Domains, and it's pretty cheap (usually around $12/year, automatically renewing until you cancel).

I recommend following the first one since it's a lot simpler/more straight forward, but the second one is more thorough incase you get stuck somewhere.
