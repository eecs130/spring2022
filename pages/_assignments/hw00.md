## Tutorial Sign-Ups
As described in the [syllabus](../syllabus/), this course involves weekly tutorial sessions where you will will work in smaller groups with a member of the teaching staff. Tutorials begin **this week**, and will be run synchronously (live) by your assigned peer mentors via Zoom.

Tutorial sessions count for 20% of your grade and your weekly attendance is **strongly encouraged**.
