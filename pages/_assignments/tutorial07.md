For today's tutorial, please work with your peer mentor to get started on [Homework 4](hw04). You know everything that you need to know to complete it! If you can, please try to accomplish 
at least Step 1 (Display Artist) and ideally Step 2 (Display Tracks).

## Turn in your files via GitHub
To get credit for Tutorial 7, you will just post what you've accomplished so far in [Homework 4](hw04). To do this, move your `hw04` folder into your repo folder (if it's not there already). Then, before you submit this week, please edit the homepage that you made in [Tutorial 4](tutorial04) by adding a link to the `hw04/your_task/index.html` file that you worked on today.

1. Check the status of your repo:<br>`$ git status`<br>It should say that your hw04 files are “untracked”
1. Add all of your hw04 files to the list of files that are tracked by the repo:<br>`$ git add hw04`
1. Check the status of your repo again:<br>`$ git status`<br>It should now say that you hw04 files are being tracked.
1. Now, commit your new hw04 files to the repo:<br>`$ git commit -m "Adding my hw04 to the repo"`
1. Finally, “push” your files to GitHub:<br>`$ git push`
1. Paste a link to your GitHub repo and to your GitHub pages
