Your last tutorial of the quarter is **REQUIRED** and involves presenting your final presentations to the rest of your section. Please prepare an informal, 3-minute presentation (slides optional) that addresses the following prompts: 

1. What did you make and why did you make it (show live demo)?
1. How did you make it?
1. What would you do next if you had more time?
1. What did you learn?

This will be very informal â€” it is just a chance for you to celebrate your accomplishments, share your project / ideas, and get some feedback from your peers.
