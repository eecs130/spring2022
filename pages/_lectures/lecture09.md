Today we will begin examining JavaScript, and will therefore need to learn a little bit of programming. We will begin by practicing how to programmatically manipulate the DOM (in a way that is very similar to using CSS selectors).

I have also assigned you (1) some JavaScript videos from O'Reilly Media, and (2) a W3Schools webpage that each cover how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM. To watch the O'Reilly video, log into Safari Books with your NU account.
