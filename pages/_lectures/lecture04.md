<img class="module-image" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/lectures/lecture04-css.png" /> Today we are going to go over some of the core rules of CSS and do a practice activity (see below). I **absolutely recommend** that you review the LinkedIn Learning videos that are referenced in the supplemental materials. Whereas you can kind of wing it with HTML tags and look them up as needed, having a sense of how CSS works is essential to making professional-looking websites. When you have completed this lesson, you should be familiar with selectors, how to specify color values, some font properties, and the "box model."
