## Do the Activity: Communicating values using visual design
**Scenario:** You are building your own personal website / online portfolio and want to visually communicate your own unique values and brand identity. Please complete the following three tasks:

### 1. Values activity
Using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vv5tPZ8UjqJNYO9pCp_PQhxHT8qoGY09deKX6uygUFA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">list of values</a>, select 5 that best describe the values that you want to communicate about yourself. Then narrow those down to 3 values (you don't want too many or you will dilute your main message).

### 2. Search for inspiration
The best way to learn how to design is to look at great designs! Go out to the internet and bookmark 5-10 web pages, images, advertisements, banners, etc. that you think look great! Why do they look great? What choices have they made in terms of:

* Alignment
* Contrast
* Proximity
* Color
* Typography
* Textures
* Images

Take a look at the [Design Resources page](/spring2021/design-reference/).

### 3. Create a style tile
Use the style guide template in <a href="/spring2021/course-files/lectures/lecture07.zip" target="_blank">the zip file</a> to create your own style tile, instantiating the values that you selected above. Ideally, you will create at least two style tiles, but let's start with one. Based on the 3 final values you have chosen to convey from step 1, play around with colors, textures, fonts, etc. in the `style.css` file.
