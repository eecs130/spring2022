## Logging Into Zoom

For security purposes, all zoom meetings will require that you sign-in via your NU account. To do this, you will first navigate to <a href="https://northwestern.zoom.us" target="_blank">https://northwestern.zoom.us</a>, and then join the corresponding meeting. If you don't login to zoom or if you are logged in as a user other than through the NU Single Sign-On, you won't be able to join the zoom.

## Finding Your Zoom Link
* We will have different zoom links for different kinds of activities. All zoom links corresponding to lectures, office hours, and tutorials will be made available via the [course calendar](../times-locations/). All zoom meetings will be password-protected (see Canvas for passwords).
* The zoom link for all lectures (Mo, We 4:00-4:50PM) is: <a href="https://northwestern.zoom.us/j/92514807708" target="_blank">https://northwestern.zoom.us/j/92514807708</a> (Meeting ID: 925 1480 7708).

## Recording (Audio / Video)
We **will** be recording all sessions during regularly scheduled class time. We WILL NOT be recording office hours or tutorial sessions in order to protect students' privacy.

## Etiquette
To ensure a smooth lecture experience for everyone, we’ll need to follow some simple guidelines.

1. To protect your privacy and avoid outside disruptions, all class-related Zoom meetings will require authentication and be password-protected. You will need to connect to Zoom using Northwestern Single Sign-On (other Zoom accounts you may have will not work). Passwords will be available on the Canvas "Syllabus" page.
2. Keep your audio and video muted at all times, unless you’re asking a question. Your audio and video should be muted by default when you join the lecture meetings.
3. To ask a question (I love questions!), please use the "raise hand" feature of Zoom. In the "Participants" pane (opened using the "Participants" button at the bottom of the screen), there is a "raise hand" button. When you raise your hand, I will receive a pop-up, and will acknowledge your question as soon as appropriate.
4. To ask your question, please unmute your audio (and video, if you want), ask, then mute yourself again. Repeat as needed for follow-ups.
5. We will have a member of the course staff present during lectures to monitor the meeting and the chat. If you think I may not have noticed your question (give me a few moments), or if asking your question directly is an issue (e.g., you prefer not be to recorded, or do not have a microphone), send the staff member on duty a direct message using Zoom’s chat feature.
6. To avoid audio feedback when you speak up, please use headphones during Zoom meetings.
7. Please refrain from "experimenting" with the various buttons in the interface, to avoid accidentally disrupting lecture. Zoom has a number of interesting features, but lecture is not the time to fiddle with them. If you want to try things out, please use a different meeting at a different time. I’m happy to help you with that if you want.
8. We may need to adapt the above and/or introduce new guidelines as the quarter goes on. But above all, we’re relying on everyone doing their part to ensure a conducive learning environment. Thank you for your cooperation.
