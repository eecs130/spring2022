## About the Course
This course is an introduction to the web, and assumes no prior knowledge. If you feel like you know nothing about coding (as in computer code) or design, but are a little bit curious about the web, then this course for you. If you’ve had quite a bit of experience with coding and design but want to continue developing your skills / portfolio, then this course may also be for you, although you may eventually want to explore additional courses offered in the CS Department (e.g. Agile Programming, Information Visualization, Intro to HCI, etc.).

Websites are living documents that require multiple forms of expertise to design and build -- understanding the needs of the users and organizations, understanding technical and computational ideas, understanding potential implications of design decisions, etc. Moreover, as web techniques/technologies continue to evolve, it is also import to "learn how to learn" about new technologies, including interpreting technical documentation, modifying and adapting sample code, and thinking about whether or not to use an external library (versus building something from scratch). Developing these competencies involves cultivating a variety of practices and dispositions (versus acquiring some fixed body of knowledge).

Taking this course means committing – for 10 weeks – to practicing your emergent coding skills, turning in weekly assignments, committing to doing homework, being present in class for individual and group activities, and most importantly, persevering when things get confusing/difficult and asking questions. Your enjoyment and success in this course depends on your commitment to showing up, engaging, and practicing your developing skills and ideas.

## Course Format
### Lectures
Lectures will take place during class time, and will be recorded. I will also assign you readings and video tutorials, which will be posted on the course website.

### Tutorial Sessions
This course also involves weekly small-group tutorial sessions where you will work with a member of the teaching staff, beginning in Week 1. Tutorial sessions will be run synchronously (live) by your assigned peer mentors. During each tutorial session, you will work through an exercise together with your peer mentor, to advance your understanding of various web concepts. 

All Tutorials are due on Friday at 11:59PM and are graded pass / fail. We will typically not grade you on attendance. That said: 

* Your attendance will be required for some tutorial sessions, as you will be presenting your final project and getting feedback from others.
* Attending the tutorial is a form of low-pressure, built-in accountability that will help you learn.

Following the submission deadline, solutions will be made available via Canvas.

### Homework and Projects
The majority of your grade will be based on 4 homework assignments and one final project -- creating a website of your choosing -- that you will complete over the course of the quarter. 

## Course Staff

### Office Hours
Consider office hours as an extension of the class, and we want you to rely on them to get the help you need for assignments. We expect that everyone will need to attend office hours from time to time throughout the quarter. Many students opt to go every week. Office hours will be posted on the course's [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bDkydXZnbjZ1Y2MwY2tidjZwN25ucnUyczhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).


## Course Materials and Resources
### Free Online Books
* Lynda.com (using the campus subscription)


### Software
As this is a programming course, you will be using the free software programs listed below. This software will take about 3GB of space to install. Installing and configuring programming software can be a hassle, but it is part of the process of developing your working computing knowledge.  We will help you.

* Visual Studio Code
* Git and Github


## Getting Questions Answered
### Assignment & Programming Questions
For assignment and programming related questions you should post questions on our class Piazza site. Before you post a question, please do a quick search to make sure that one of your classmates hasn’t already asked the same question. Piazza gives you the option of posting anonymously (to your classmates) so that you don’t feel intimidated to ask a question. As a general rule, do not post ANY code that would be part of an answer to an assignment question. It is critical that you use Piazza for assignment questions; any assignment questions emailed directly to any course staff will be forwarded to Piazza.


If you have a question about code that requires you to show someone your code, please go to one of the peer mentor hosted office hours. These hours (days/times/locations) are posted on a google calendar linked to from the Piazza resources page (under the ‘course information’ tab) for our class. In general, please use the peer mentor hours, these mentors were selected from a large number of applicants and are highly qualified!


### Grading Questions
If you believe that your assignment has been misgraded, please send a private message on Campuswire within 1 week to Sarah, with an explanation of the potential grading error. Finally, it is your responsibility to keep up-to-date on class material and announcements. This includes material presented and announcements made in class, via email, or on Campuswire.


### Other Questions
For any other issues that you think are not appropriate for the peer mentors, please come talk to me. This might include things like concerns about your progress in the course, questions about content from my lectures, personal matter related to your participation in the course, larger grade concerns, advice about future courses, majors and internships, etc.


## Grading
This course will consist of weekly homework assignments and tutorial exercises, which will help you build up to a final project. There will be 10 tutorials. You may miss 2 without a grade penalty. Your passes are to be used for sickness, unexpected events, etc., so don't cash them in too early!

{:.small}
| **4 Homeworks** | 4 x 10 Points | 40% |
| **1 Project** | 1 x 20 Points | 40% |
| **8 Tutorials** | 8 x 2.5 Points | 20% |
| | | **100%** |

Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is an A, 90-92.99 is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. Some other logistics:

1. Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.
2. We will NOT be using the final exam time for this class.
3. You will be presenting your final project during your tutorial section on the last day.

### Homework Grading
Homework will be approximately weekly. Homework assignments are due at 11:59pm on Thursdays, unless otherwise specified. Each day your homework is late, we will apply a 10% deduction. If your homework is 5 or more days late, the most you can earn is a 50% (see the HW grading formula below): 

```js
// JavaScript formula:
Math.max(0.5, (1 - numDaysLate * 0.1)) * score
```

I do not give extensions unless they come from the Dean of Students or from Accessible NU.

## Policy on Academic Honesty
In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which students have presented work other than their own. For the programming assignments: You are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working “together” and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable. Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the line:

1. Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form – on paper, via e-mail, or by other means.
2. Do not copy solutions from any source, including the web or previous CS 130 students.
3. While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).
4. Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by Northwestern’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in Northwestern’s Student Conduct Code.

Contact Sarah Van Wart if you have any questions about what is appropriate.
