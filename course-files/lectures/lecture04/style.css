       font-family, font-size, line-height, color, font-size, 
       text-transform, letter-spacing

   Hint: use the margin and padding properties

3. Style the navigation bar.
   Hint: use the following text properties:
     background-color, padding

4. Style the img tag and see if you can make it look like itâ€™s sitting in a picture frame.
   Hint: use the following box-model properties: 
     padding, border, border-radius, box-shadow, width

5. Create a class that, when applied, turns the text to hot pink.
